# learn-java-together
This repository is a collaborative learning space for mastering Java from the basics to advanced topics

🎯 Goal: This repository is a structured 16-week Java bootcamp to help developers move from beginner to expert by solving real-world coding exercises and working on projects.

📌 Each week contains Java exercises and mini-projects that you need to solve and submit as separate files (e.g., Calculator44.java). This ensures everyone writes unique solutions while following best practices.
